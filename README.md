## 🧰 Purpose & Background

In real-world scenarios, user-submitted addresses are often unstructured. For example:

> 张三 13512345678 北京市朝阳区建国路88号 邮编100000

Manually parsing such data is not only inefficient but also error-prone. The `hejunjie/address-parser` is designed specifically to solve this problem of **unstructured address parsing**, and is suitable for a wide range of use cases:

- 🛒 Processing order addresses in e-commerce systems
- 📦 Address recognition in logistics and delivery services
- 🧾 User profile completion in admin panels
- 📱 Address input validation in mini-programs or mobile apps

Whether for personal projects or enterprise systems, it significantly boosts automation and accuracy in address handling.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

The inspiration for this package originally came from a friend who mentioned the idea in an issue on one of my other repositories, even kindly sharing another friend's implementation: [pupuk/address](https://github.com/pupuk/address). I found the concept very interesting, and thanks to that inspiration, I created `hejunjie/address-parser`.

Thanks to him for the idea — I hope this little tool helps more people 🙌
